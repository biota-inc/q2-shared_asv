def compute(table: biom.Table, sample_a: str, sample_b: str, metadata: qiime2.Metadata, percentage: float) -> biom.Table:
    """
    Compute the shared ASVs between two input samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : biom.Table
        The feature table containing the data.
    sample_a : str
        The sample ID of the first sample to include in the analysis.
    sample_b : str
        The sample ID of the second sample to include in the analysis.
    metadata : qiime2.Metadata
        The metadata associated with the feature table.
    percentage : float
        The minimum relative frequency required for a feature to be included in the analysis.

    Returns
    -------
    shared_asvs : biom.Table
        A new feature table containing only the ASVs that are shared between the two input samples, and have a relative frequency greater than or equal to the input percentage.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If either of the input sample IDs are not present in the feature table.

    Notes
    -----
    The function first filters the input feature table to include only the two input samples, based on their sample IDs. It then merges the two filtered tables into a single table of shared ASVs, and filters this table to include only the ASVs with a relative frequency greater than or equal to the input percentage. If no ASVs meet this criteria, an empty feature table is returned.
